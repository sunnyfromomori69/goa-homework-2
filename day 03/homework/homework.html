<h1>information about Python.</h1>

<p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica  in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" , a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project</p>

<h3>What is Python all about</h3>
<p>Python is a programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented, and considered to be high-level too. What is Python? Python is one of the easiest yet most useful programming languages which is widely used in the software industry. People use Python for Competitive Programming, Web Development, and creating software. Due to its easiest syntax, it is recommended for beginners who are new to the software engineering field. Its demand is growing at a very rapid pace due to its vast use cases in Modern Technological fields like Data Science, Machine learning, and Automation Tasks. For many years now, it has been ranked among the top Programming languages.</p>
